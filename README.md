## Description

  ### Motivation 
This project is my first challenge in my coding boot camp course. The project is meant  to sharpens my skill on "accessibility." In addition, to test my ability to adapt and refactor a webpage for a company. 
  ### The Why
The purpose of this project is to build a function webpage that is more accessible for their audience. In addition, to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website using different forms of assistive technolgies. Creating a accesible webpage is good business practice.
  ### The Problem
 By refactoring the webpage it allows for a webpage that more accessible to people with disabilties. This will help the company avoid any litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.
  ### My Insight Gained
 I learned alot from this project. I was able to use the information gained from previous modules and apply them during this project. For example, I was able to condense multiple CSS selectors into one group/element to reduce teh amount of code for future developer. Furthermore, I used an actual screen reader to test my edits to make sure the site was accesibility friendly. For instance, my screen reader read the description I provided for an image in the webpage. Over the course of the assignment, I was able to put into practice different skills such as:
  - Use different <html> tags appropriately.
  - add alt tags to an image to provide descriptions.
  - add comments to my HTML and CSS for organization and best practices.
  - Use what I learned from previous modules to edit CSS classes, selectors, and CSS properties.
